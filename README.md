This project presents an interactive graphical tool for exploring and understanding Single Layer a and visualization of the decision boundary. 
Users can intuitively interact with the application by adding data points and training a perceptron model to classify points into multiple classes using the sigmoid activation function.

 In this window, you can select classes from a dropdown menu and place dots on the coordinates to provide samples for the selected classes. After that, when you press 'Train Model,' it will separate the classes using a linear boundary.
